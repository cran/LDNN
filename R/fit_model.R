#' @param n_epoch The number of epochs to train the model.
#' @param bsize The batch size.
#' @param X1 Features as inputs of 1st LSTM.
#' @param X2 Features as inputs of 2nd LSTM.
#' @param X3 Features as inputs of 3rd LSTM.
#' @param X4 Features as inputs of 4th LSTM.
#' @param X5 Features as inputs of 5th LSTM.
#' @param X6 Features as inputs of 6th LSTM.
#' @param X7 Features as inputs of 7th LSTM.
#' @param X8 Features as inputs of 8th LSTM.
#' @param X9 Features as inputs of 9th LSTM.
#' @param X10 Features as inputs of 10th LSTM.
#' @param Xif The features to be concatenated with the outputs of the LSTMs.
#' @param y The target variable.
#' @return The fitted model.
#' @description Fit the created Neural Network model (Keras).
